# Cart History & Restore Feature

## Overview
This feature allows users to restore their shopping cart to any previous state, enabling them to undo cart additions or revert to specific points in time.

## How It Works

### Cart History Tracking
- **Automatic Tracking**: Every cart action (add, remove, increase quantity, decrease quantity, clear) is automatically tracked with a timestamp
- **Local Storage**: History is persisted in browser's localStorage for session persistence
- **Memory Management**: Only the last 20 cart states are kept to prevent memory bloat

### Restore Interface
- **Restore Button**: Appears in the order summary area when cart history exists (ðŸ•’ Restore Cart)
- **History Modal**: Shows chronological list of all cart states with:
  - Timestamp of each action
  - Action type (color-coded badges)
  - Total items and price for each state
  - Preview of items in that cart state
- **One-Click Restore**: Click any history entry to instantly restore the cart to that state

## Data Structure

Each history entry contains:
```javascript
{
  id: 1758581812913,                    // Unique timestamp ID
  timestamp: "2025-09-22T22:56:52.913Z", // ISO timestamp
  cart: [...],                          // Complete cart state
  action: "add",                        // Action type
  totalItems: 1,                        // Total quantity
  totalPrice: 25                        // Total price
}
```

## Action Types
- `initial` - Empty cart on app load
- `add` - Item added to cart
- `remove` - Item removed from cart  
- `increase` - Quantity increased
- `decrease` - Quantity decreased
- `clear` - Cart cleared
- `restore` - Cart restored to previous state

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Add items to your cart as normal
2. If you need to undo changes, click "ðŸ•’ Restore Cart" in the order summary
3. Select any previous cart state from the history list
4. Your cart will instantly revert to that state

### For Developers
The feature integrates seamlessly with existing cart functionality:

**Key Functions:**
- `saveCartToHistory(cart, action)` - Saves cart state to history
- `restoreCartToTime(historyEntry)` - Restores cart to specific state
- `RestoreCartModal` - UI component for selecting restore points

**Integration Points:**
- `App.js` - Main cart logic and history management
- `MenuPage.js` - Restore button in cart actions
- `RestoreCartModal.js` - History selection interface

## Bilingual Support
The interface supports both English and Arabic:
- English: "ðŸ•’ Restore Cart" 
- Arabic: "ðŸ•’ Ø§Ø³ØªØ¹Ø§Ø¯Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø±Ø¨Ø©"

## Browser Compatibility
Works in all modern browsers that support:
- localStorage API
- ES6 JavaScript features
- React 16.8+ (hooks)
